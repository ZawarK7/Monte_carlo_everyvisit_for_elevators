# Monte_carlo_everyvisit_for_elevators

This repository contains a Python implementation of an Elevator Control System using the Every Visit Monte Carlo reinforcement learning algorithm. The project simulates an elevator environment with multiple floors, elevator cars, and passenger requests. Through reinforcement learning, the elevator learns to make optimal decisions to efficiently pick up and drop off passengers, while minimizing travel distance and maximizing rewards.

Features:

Simulated environment with customizable number of floors and elevators.
Elevator control logic based on Q-values learned through Every Visit Monte Carlo updates.
Simple passenger movement simulation for demonstration purposes.
Visualization of Q-value convergence over training episodes.

Usage:

Clone the repository.
Run the Python script to train the elevator control system.
Observe the Q-value convergence and the improvement in elevator performance through visualization.


Please note that this implementation is a simplified example for educational purposes and may not cover all complexities of real-world elevator control systems. Contributions and improvements are welcome!
